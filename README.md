# Geomappy 

A basic Flask app for geocoding addressed and generating map from points

- Upload a .csv with a list of addresses or download a template to fill out.
- Once uploaded the addresses are geocoded and the infomation in displayed in a table n the website.
- You can then choose to download a geo-coded version Excel file or to view a automated map of the addresses.

This app is an extension of a project I did in the Udemy course by Ardit Sulce:
